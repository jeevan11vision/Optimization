## Optimization

Three functions quadratic, log transform and bi-quadratic are optimized using the following three optimization methods.

1. Gradient Descent
2. Newton's Method
3. Quasi-Newton's Method

### Usage

1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the following command for optimization which outputs results in `reports` directory

```bash
python -m src.run
```

You can change the configuration for running the algorithms, you can change `configs/config.yml` file.
